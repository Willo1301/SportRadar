BACK END TASK.

HOW TO USE : 

° download file project.
° With xamp export database named "sport_event.sql" from the project file.
° Open the project file with Virtual Studio Code.



To create this project, i started by making a database in line with the theme. The project being an event calandar.
I used mySql for the database.

I then used PHP for the rest of the code. 

I created an index page, details page, create page, update page and deleate page. 
The idea was to make the website easy to use. Be able to create or deleate or update any event easily.

To make it look better, i used bootstrap and some css to polish the header and the footer.

I had some tasks to complete, and made the project according to those tasks.

If i had more time, i would make a better "details page". With team's players, venue, etc.. 

The only use of AI in this project was to create the "sort" button.
